## Overview

Enhanced the leaderboard page with tabbed interface showing comprehensive statistics for companies, players, and products.

## Date

October 6, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes (`convex/leaderboard.ts`)

Added three new query functions to fetch all entities with full statistics:

#### `getAllCompanies`

- Fetches all companies (up to 500)
- Returns enriched data including:
  - Company name, ticker, logo
  - Share price, total shares, market cap
  - Balance, monthly revenue
  - Public/Private status
  - Owner name
  - Created date
- Optimized with batch fetching for accounts and owners

#### `getAllPlayers`

- Fetches all players (up to 500)
- Returns enriched data including:
  - Player name, username, avatar
  - Cash balance
  - Portfolio value (calculated from stock holdings)
  - Net worth (cash + portfolio)
  - Total number of holdings
- Optimized with batch fetching for accounts, holdings, and companies

#### `getAllProducts`

- Fetches all products (up to 1000)
- Returns enriched data including:
  - Product name, price, image
  - Total sales, revenue, costs, profit
  - Quality percentage
  - Active/Inactive status
  - Company name, ticker, logo
  - Created date
- Optimized with batch fetching for company information

### 2. Frontend Changes (`app/routes/dashboard/leaderboard.tsx`)

#### New Imports

## Features

### Performance Optimizations

- All queries use batch fetching to minimize database reads
- Limited result sets (500 companies, 500 players, 1000 products)
- Efficient data enrichment with Map structures
- Reuses existing optimization patterns from the codebase

### User Experience

- Clean tabbed interface for easy navigation
- Responsive tables with horizontal scroll on mobile
- Color-coded profit values (green for positive, red for negative)
- Status badges for visual quick reference
- Consistent formatting across all tables
- Avatar/logo display for visual identification
- Sortable data (pre-sorted by most relevant metric)

### Data Integrity

- Handles missing data gracefully (null checks)
- Normalizes image URLs
- Formats currency and numbers consistently
- Shows meaningful fallback values

## Usage

Navigate to `/dashboard/leaderboard` to see:

1. **Overview Tab**: Quick snapshot of top performers (existing functionality)
2. **Companies Tab**: Complete company rankings and statistics
3. **Players Tab**: Complete player rankings and wealth analysis
4. **Products Tab**: Complete product performance metrics

## Technical Details

### Query Performance

- Companies: ~500 max results, 2 batch queries (accounts + owners)
- Players: ~500 max results, 3 batch queries (accounts + holdings + companies)
- Products: ~1000 max results, 1 batch query (companies)

### Responsive Design

- Tables scroll horizontally on small screens
- Tab buttons stack appropriately
- Text truncation for long names
- Flexible column widths

### Type Safety

- Full TypeScript types throughout
- Convex-generated types for database entities
- Proper null handling

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- Search/filter functionality within each tab
- Pagination for very large datasets
- Column sorting in the UI
- Export to CSV functionality
- Time range filters
- Detailed drill-down modals
- Real-time updates with Convex subscriptions
