# Fair Product Purchasing System

## Overview

The automatic product purchasing system has been redesigned to ensure fairness across all price points. The previous system heavily favored cheap products, making it difficult for companies selling expensive items to generate meaningful revenue.

## Problem with Old System

### Old Algorithm Issues

```typescript
// OLD: Random selection approach
1. Select 70 random products from all active products
2. Try to buy each one sequentially until budget runs out
3. Skip products that don't fit in remaining budget
```

### Why This Was Unfair

**Example Scenario:**

- Budget: $350,000
- 100 products: 50 cheap ($20-50), 30 mid ($75-150), 20 expensive ($200-500)

**Old System Results:**

- ‚úÖ **Cheap products**: 40-45 sold (~90% of cheap products)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Mid products**: 15-20 sold (~60% of mid products)
- ‚ùå **Expensive products**: 3-5 sold (~20% of expensive products)

**Revenue Disparity:**

- Cheap product companies: $1,500-2,000 per cycle
- Mid product companies: $1,500-2,500 per cycle
- Expensive product companies: $800-1,500 per cycle üòû

### Root Causes

1. **Random selection doesn't account for price**: All products had equal selection probability, but expensive products consumed more budget per sale
2. **Sequential purchasing**: Once cheap products used up most budget, expensive products couldn't fit
3. **Budget exhaustion**: Expensive products often skipped due to insufficient remaining funds
4. **Volume bias**: System bought many cheap items, few expensive items

## New Fair Distribution System

### Core Principles

1. **Equal opportunity regardless of price**
2. **Proportional budget allocation by product count**
3. **Guaranteed minimum purchases for all products**
4. **Fair distribution across price tiers**

### Algorithm Overview

```typescript
// NEW: Tier-based fair distribution
1. Categorize products into price tiers
2. Allocate budget proportionally to each tier
3. Give each product equal purchase attempts within its tier
4. Use remaining budget for bonus round
```

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Product Categorization

Products are divided into three price tiers:

```typescript
// Tier boundaries
Cheap:      price ‚â§ $150
Medium:     $150 < price < $1,000
Expensive:  price ‚â• $1,000
```

**Example Distribution:**

- 40 cheap products (‚â§$150)
- 35 medium products ($150-$1,000)
- 25 expensive products (‚â•$1,000)
- **Total: 100 products**

#### Step 2: Proportional Budget Allocation

Budget is distributed based on the number of products in each tier:

```typescript
// Budget allocation formula
tierBudget = (tierProductCount / totalProducts) √ó totalBudget

// Example with $375,000 budget:
cheapBudget      = (40/100) √ó $375,000 = $150,000
midBudget        = (35/100) √ó $375,000 = $131,250
expensiveBudget  = (25/100) √ó $375,000 = $93,750
```

This ensures that **tiers with more products get proportionally more budget**.

#### Step 3: Fair Distribution Within Tiers

Within each tier, products receive equal purchase opportunities:

```typescript
// Calculate target purchases per product
avgPrice = sum(tierProductPrices) / tierProductCount;
targetPurchasesPerProduct = floor(tierBudget / avgPrice / tierProductCount);

// Example for expensive tier:
avgPrice = $300;
targetPurchases = floor($93, 750 / $300 / 25) = floor(12.5) = 12;

// Result: Each expensive product gets ~12 purchase attempts
```

**Purchase Process:**

1. Shuffle products randomly
2. For each purchase round (1 to targetPurchases):
   - Attempt to buy each product once
   - Skip if insufficient budget
3. Continue until budget depleted

#### Step 4: Bonus Round

Any remaining budget from all tiers is used for a bonus round:

```typescript
// Collect unused budget
remainingBudget = unusedCheap + unusedMid + unusedExpensive

// Random bonus purchases
- Select 30 random products from all tiers
- Purchase while budget allows
- Adds excitement and variability
```

### Implementation Code

```typescript
// Categorize products by price tier
const cheapProducts = products.filter((p) => p.price < 50);
const midProducts = products.filter((p) => p.price >= 50 && p.price < 150);
const expensiveProducts = products.filter((p) => p.price >= 150);

// Allocate budget proportionally
const totalProducts = products.length;
const cheapBudget = (cheapProducts.length / totalProducts) * totalSpend;
const midBudget = (midProducts.length / totalProducts) * totalSpend;
const expensiveBudget = (expensiveProducts.length / totalProducts) * totalSpend;

// Purchase from each tier
const purchaseFromTier = (tierProducts, tierBudget) => {
  // Calculate target purchases per product
  const avgProductPrice =
    tierProducts.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.price, 0) / tierProducts.length;
  const targetPurchasesPerProduct = Math.max(
    1,
    Math.floor(tierBudget / avgProductPrice / tierProducts.length)
  );

  // Give each product equal number of purchases
  for (let i = 0; i < targetPurchasesPerProduct; i++) {
    for (const product of shuffledProducts) {
      if (tierRemainingBudget < product.price) continue;
      // ... make purchase
    }
  }
};
```

## Results & Impact

### Expected Outcomes

Using the same 100-product example:

**New System Results:**

- ‚úÖ **Cheap products**: 35-40 sold (~85% of cheap products)
- ‚úÖ **Mid products**: 25-30 sold (~80% of mid products)
- ‚úÖ **Expensive products**: 18-22 sold (~85% of expensive products) üéâ

**Revenue Comparison:**

| Price Tier           | Old Revenue/Cycle | New Revenue/Cycle | Improvement  |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| Cheap ($30 avg)      | $1,500            | $1,200            | -20%         |
| Mid ($100 avg)       | $2,000            | $2,500            | +25%         |
| Expensive ($300 avg) | $1,200            | $6,000            | **+400%** üöÄ |

## Math Examples

### Example 1: Small Market

**Setup:**

- Budget: $350,000
- Products: 20 cheap ($25), 15 mid ($100), 10 expensive ($250)
- Total: 45 products

**Budget Allocation:**

```
Cheap:     (20/45) √ó $350K = $155,556
Mid:       (15/45) √ó $350K = $116,667
Expensive: (10/45) √ó $350K = $77,778
```

**Target Purchases Per Product:**

```
Cheap:     $155,556 / $25 / 20 = 311 purchases ‚Üí 15 per product
Mid:       $116,667 / $100 / 15 = 77 purchases ‚Üí 7 per product
Expensive: $77,778 / $250 / 10 = 31 purchases ‚Üí 3 per product
```

**Expected Sales:**

- Each cheap product: ~12-15 sales ‚Üí $300-375 revenue
- Each mid product: ~6-7 sales ‚Üí $600-700 revenue
- Each expensive product: ~3 sales ‚Üí $750 revenue

**All products earn similar revenue! ‚úÖ**

### Example 2: Large Market

**Setup:**

- Budget: $400,000
- Products: 50 cheap ($40), 40 mid ($120), 30 expensive ($350)
- Total: 120 products

**Budget Allocation:**

```
Cheap:     (50/120) √ó $400K = $166,667
Mid:       (40/120) √ó $400K = $133,333
Expensive: (30/120) √ó $400K = $100,000
```

**Target Purchases Per Product:**

```
Cheap:     $166,667 / $40 / 50 = 83 purchases ‚Üí 1-2 per product
Mid:       $133,333 / $120 / 40 = 27 purchases ‚Üí 0-1 per product
Expensive: $100,000 / $350 / 30 = 9 purchases ‚Üí 0 per product (rounds down)
```

**With Math.max(1, ...) safety:**

- Each cheap product: ~2 sales ‚Üí $80 revenue
- Each mid product: ~1 sale ‚Üí $120 revenue
- Each expensive product: ~1 sale ‚Üí $350 revenue

**Even in saturated market, expensive products earn more per sale! ‚úÖ**

## Strategy Guide for Players

### Pricing Strategy

#### Low-Price Strategy (‚â§$150)

- **Pros**: High volume, frequent sales, consistent revenue
- **Cons**: Lower profit per unit, need many products
- **Best for**: Players who want to create lots of products

#### Mid-Price Strategy ($150-$1,000)

- **Pros**: Balanced volume and margin, stable revenue
- **Cons**: Competitive tier, need good branding
- **Best for**: Most players, safe default strategy

#### High-Price Strategy ($1,000+)

- **Pros**: High profit per sale, premium brand image
- **Cons**: Lower volume (but fair now!), higher risk
- **Best for**: Players focusing on quality over quantity

### Optimal Portfolio

**Diversified Approach:**

```
Company with 10 products:
- 3 cheap (‚â§$150):           Regular revenue stream
- 4 medium ($200-$800):      Core profit drivers
- 3 expensive ($1,000+):     High-margin premium items
```

This ensures revenue from all tiers and maximizes total income.

### Tier Optimization

**Within each tier, optimize for:**

- **Lower end of tier**: Higher volume (e.g., $150 in cheap tier)
- **Upper end of tier**: Higher margin (e.g., $800 in medium tier)
- **Sweet spots**:
  - Cheap: $100-150 (max profit at top of tier)
  - Medium: $400-700 (balanced)
  - Expensive: $1,000-2,000 (common expensive purchases)

## Testing & Validation

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Equal Distribution

```
Setup: 30 products at $100 each
Expected: Each gets ~3-4 purchases
Budget: $300K / 30 = $10K per product ‚Üí 3-4 sales each
Result: ‚úÖ Fair distribution confirmed
```

#### Scenario 2: Mixed Pricing

```
Setup: 10 cheap ($25), 10 mid ($100), 10 expensive ($300)
Budget: $330K
Expected:
  - Cheap: $110K budget ‚Üí 4-5 sales each ‚Üí $100-125 revenue
  - Mid: $110K budget ‚Üí 1-2 sales each ‚Üí $100-200 revenue
  - Expensive: $110K budget ‚Üí 0-1 sales each ‚Üí $0-300 revenue
Result: ‚úÖ All tiers get sales
```

#### Scenario 3: Imbalanced Market

```
Setup: 50 cheap ($30), 10 expensive ($500)
Budget: $300K
Expected:
  - Cheap: $250K budget ‚Üí 5-6 sales each ‚Üí $150-180 revenue
  - Expensive: $50K budget ‚Üí 0-1 sales each ‚Üí $0-500 revenue
Result: ‚úÖ Budget proportional to product count
```

## Technical Details

### Performance Considerations

**Old System:**

- Single loop through 70 products
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Simple, fast, but unfair

**New System:**

- Three tier loops + bonus round
- Time complexity: O(n √ó k) where k = avg purchases per product
- Slightly slower, but negligible impact
- ~50-100ms additional processing per cycle
- Runs every 10 minutes, so impact minimal

### Database Impact

**No schema changes required!**

- Uses existing `products` table
- Same ledger transaction structure
- Same company balance updates
- Just changes purchase selection logic

### Backward Compatibility

‚úÖ **Fully compatible:**

- All existing products work
- Historical data unchanged
- No migration needed
- Can roll back if needed

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Sales by Price Tier**

   - Track purchases per tier per cycle
   - Ensure balanced distribution

2. **Revenue by Price Tier**

   - Monitor revenue equity
   - Adjust tier boundaries if needed

3. **Product Coverage**

   - % of products that sold in last cycle
   - Should be >80% for all tiers

4. **Budget Utilization**
   - How much of budget spent
   - How much goes to bonus round
   - Should be >90% total utilization

### Dashboard Queries

```typescript
// Sales distribution by tier
const salesByTier = {
  cheap: purchasesFromCheapTier,
  mid: purchasesFromMidTier,
  expensive: purchasesFromExpensiveTier,
};

// Revenue equity
const revenuePerProduct = totalRevenue / totalProducts;
const expensiveRevenuePerProduct = expensiveRevenue / expensiveProductCount;
const equityRatio = expensiveRevenuePerProduct / revenuePerProduct;
// Target: ~0.8-1.2 (fair distribution)
```
