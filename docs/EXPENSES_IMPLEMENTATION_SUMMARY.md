## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

### Database Bandwidth

- **Batching:** One expense per company per day (not per transaction)
- **Caching:** Monthly revenue cached on company record
- **Indexing:** All queries use proper indexes
- **Limits:** Max 100 companies/200 products per cron run

### Expected Load

- Daily expenses: ~1,000 operations for 100 companies
- Weekly quality: ~400 operations for 200 products
- Total: ~150 operations per hour
- **Impact:** Minimal - well within Convex limits

### Smart Processing

- Skip if processed within 24 hours
- Only charge if company can afford it
- Accumulate unpaid taxes instead of failing
- Quality degradation skips recently maintained products

## üéÆ Gameplay Impact

### Strategic Depth

- Players must balance growth with sustainability
- Tax planning becomes important
- License renewal is a recurring cost
- Product quality requires maintenance investment

### Revenue Pressure

- Small companies: Minimal impact (~$100-1000/month)
- Medium companies: Moderate impact (~$10k-30k/month)
- Large companies: Significant impact (~$50k-150k/month)

### Decision Points

- When to buy licenses?
- Which products to maintain first?
- How to optimize tax liability?
- Balance cash flow vs. expansion
