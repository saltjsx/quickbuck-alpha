# AI Purchase Spending Fix - $7M ‚Üí $10M+ Per Batch

## Problem
The AI purchase service was only spending around $7M total when it should be spending $10M+ per batch.

## Root Causes

1. **Weak AI Prompt**: The prompt wasn't forceful enough about hitting the minimum spend target
2. **No Fallback**: When AI didn't hit the minimum, the script just warned but accepted the low spend
3. **Vague Instructions**: AI wasn't given clear quantity guidelines per price point

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced AI Prompt (`scripts/ai-purchase-service.ts`)

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Made $10M minimum a **HARD REQUIREMENT** (emphasized with üî¥ and caps)
- ‚úÖ Added specific quantity guidelines by quality level:
  - Quality 90-100: 2,000-100,000 units
  - Quality 70-89: 1,000-50,000 units
  - Quality 50-69: 200-5,000 units
  - Quality <50: 1-100 units (minimal)

- ‚úÖ Added pricing strategy by item cost:
  - $1-$20: 5,000-100,000+ units
  - $20-$100: 2,000-50,000 units
  - $100-$500: 500-10,000 units
  - $500-$2000: 100-2,000 units
  - $2000+: 10-500 units

- ‚úÖ Gave explicit spending strategies:
  1. Start with high-quality cheap products
  2. Buy bulk quantities of medium-priced items
  3. Round UP quantities for low-price items
  4. Calculate total BEFORE responding
  5. Increase quantities if needed to reach target

- ‚úÖ Added 10 critical requirements for response format
- ‚úÖ Formatted product list with emoji quality indicators

### 2. Spending Enforcement Fallback

Added automatic quantity scaling if AI comes in under budget:

```typescript
if (totalSpend < MIN_SPEND_PER_BATCH) {
  const scale = MIN_SPEND_PER_BATCH / totalSpend;
  console.log(`üìà Scaling quantities by ${scale.toFixed(2)}x to meet minimum...`);
  
  for (const decision of decisions) {
    decision.quantity = Math.ceil(decision.quantity * scale);
  }
  
  // Recalculate and confirm
  totalSpend = decisions.reduce((sum, decision) => {
    const product = batch.find(p => p._id === decision.productId);
    return sum + (product ? product.price * decision.quantity : 0);
  }, 0);
}
```

**How it works:**
1. Calculate initial total from AI decisions
2. If under $10M, calculate scale factor (e.g., 1.5x if only spent $6.67M)
3. Multiply all quantities by scale factor
4. Confirm new total meets or exceeds $10M

## Impact

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| AI Spending (Typical) | ~$7M | $10M+ | ‚úÖ +43%+ |
| Fallback Enforcement | ‚ùå None | ‚úÖ Auto-scale | ‚úÖ Guaranteed |
| Prompt Clarity | ‚ö†Ô∏è Vague | ‚úÖ Explicit | ‚úÖ Better |

## How It Ensures Minimum Spend

1. **Aggressive Prompt**: AI now knows exact quantities per price point
2. **Hard Requirement Emphasis**: Multiple mentions of $10M minimum
3. **Calculation Instructions**: AI must calculate before responding
4. **Fallback Safety Net**: If AI still comes short, script scales up automatically

## Expected Results

Next time AI purchase service runs:
- ‚úÖ AI will aim for $10M+ per batch
- ‚úÖ If AI comes short, quantities auto-scale to hit minimum
- ‚úÖ Companies will receive guaranteed $10M per batch
- ‚úÖ Quality still prioritized (high quality = more units)

## Files Modified

1. `scripts/ai-purchase-service.ts`
   - Rewrote AI prompt (lines 109-195)
   - Added quantity scaling fallback (lines 222-237)
   - Enhanced logging (added emoji and clarity)
