# Stock Transfer Feature - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Active

## Overview

Added stock transfer functionality to the Transfers page (formerly "Send Money"), allowing users to transfer stock shares to other players or companies, in addition to money transfers.

---

## Feature Description

Users can now transfer stock shares from their personal portfolio to:

- **Other Players** - Gift or trade shares with other users
- **Companies** - Transfer shares to companies (useful for corporate investments)

This complements the existing money transfer feature, creating a complete transfer system.

---

## User Interface

### Page Structure

The Transfers page now has 2 tabs:

1. **Money** - Transfer funds between accounts (existing feature, enhanced)
2. **Stocks** - Transfer stock shares to users/companies (NEW)

### Tab Layout

```
Transfers Page
├── Money Tab
│   └── Transfer funds from accounts to users/companies
└── Stocks Tab (NEW)
    └── Transfer stock shares to users/companies
```

---

## Stock Transfer Workflow

### 1. Select Stock to Transfer

Users see a list of all their stock holdings:

- Company name and logo
- Ticker symbol
- Number of shares owned
- Current price per share

Click to select the stock to transfer.

### 2. Specify Number of Shares

Enter the number of shares to transfer:

- Min: 1 share
- Max: Total shares owned
- Validation prevents over-transfer

### 3. Choose Recipient Type

Select whether transferring to:

- **Player** (another user)
- **Company** (a company account)

### 4. Search for Recipient

Search for the recipient:

- **For Players**: Search by username or email (min 2 characters)
- **For Companies**: Search by company name or ticker (min 1 character)

### 5. Confirm Transfer

Review transfer details and submit:

- Shows preview with from/to information
- Number of shares being transferred
- Current value estimate
- Success/error feedback

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes

**File:** `app/routes/dashboard/transactions.tsx`

#### 1. Added Imports

```tsx
import { Tabs, TabsContent, TabsList, TabsTrigger } from "~/components/ui/tabs";
import { TrendingUp } from "lucide-react";
```

#### 2. New State Variables

```tsx
// Stock transfer states
const [selectedStockHolding, setSelectedStockHolding] = useState<any>(null);
const [stockRecipientType, setStockRecipientType] = useState<
  "user" | "company"
>("user");
const [stockSearchTerm, setStockSearchTerm] = useState("");
const [selectedStockRecipient, setSelectedStockRecipient] = useState<any>(null);
const [sharesToTransfer, setSharesToTransfer] = useState("");
const [stockError, setStockError] = useState("");
const [stockSuccess, setStockSuccess] = useState("");
```

#### 3. New Data Queries

```tsx
const portfolio = useQuery(api.stocks.getPortfolio);
const companies = useQuery(api.companies.getUserCompanies);
const transferStock = useMutation(api.stocks.transferStock);

// Separate search queries for stock transfers
const stockSearchUsers = useQuery(
  api.accounts.searchUsers,
  stockSearchTerm.length >= 2 && stockRecipientType === "user"
    ? { searchTerm: stockSearchTerm }
    : "skip"
);
const stockSearchCompanies = useQuery(
  api.accounts.searchCompanies,
  stockSearchTerm.length >= 1 && stockRecipientType === "company"
    ? { searchTerm: stockSearchTerm }
    : "skip"
);
```

#### 4. Transfer Handler

```tsx
const handleStockTransfer = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();

  // Validation
  if (!selectedStockHolding) {
    setStockError("Please select a stock holding");
    return;
  }

  if (!selectedStockRecipient) {
    setStockError("Please select a recipient");
    return;
  }

  const shares = parseFloat(sharesToTransfer);
  if (isNaN(shares) || shares <= 0) {
    setStockError("Please enter a valid number of shares");
    return;
  }

  if (shares > selectedStockHolding.shares) {
    setStockError("Insufficient shares");
    return;
  }

  // Execute transfer
  await transferStock({
    companyId: selectedStockHolding.companyId,
    shares: shares,
    toId: selectedStockRecipient._id,
    toType: stockRecipientType,
  });

  // Success feedback and cleanup
  setStockSuccess(`Successfully transferred ${shares} shares...`);
  // Reset form
};
```

### Backend Integration

**Uses Existing Convex Mutation:**

```typescript
// convex/stocks.ts
export const transferStock = mutation({
  args: {
    companyId: v.id("companies"),
    shares: v.number(),
    toId: v.union(v.id("users"), v.id("companies")),
    toType: v.union(v.literal("user"), v.literal("company")),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Validates user ownership
    // Checks sufficient shares
    // Creates stock transaction record
    // Updates sender holdings
    // Updates receiver holdings
    return { success: true };
  },
});
```

**No backend changes needed!** The mutation was already implemented.
