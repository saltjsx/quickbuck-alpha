## Monetary Value Summary

- `total_*` fields for aggregated values
- `share_price` and `company_value` for stock market events
- `gain_loss` for portfolio performance

## Revenue Tracking Opportunities

To track actual revenue/transactions, consider adding these events:

1. `product_purchased` - When automatic purchases occur
2. `stock_purchased` - When users buy stocks
3. `stock_sold` - When users sell stocks
4. `balance_transfer` - When money moves between accounts

## Analytics Dashboard Insights

With these events, you can track:

- **Total Product Value Created** - Sum of all `product_created.price`
- **Average Product Price** - Average of `product_created.price`
- **Price Change Trends** - `product_updated.price_change_amount`
- **Total Market Capitalization** - `stock_market_viewed.total_market_cap`
- **User Wealth Distribution** - `accounts_viewed.total_balance`
- **Portfolio Performance** - `portfolio_viewed.total_gain_loss`
- **Product Engagement** - `product_viewed` count
- **Conversion Funnels** - From `homepage_viewed` â†’ `sign_up_page_viewed` â†’ `account_initialized` â†’ `company_created`

## Testing

To test tracking in development:

1. Remove `disabled={import.meta.env.DEV}` from Databuddy component (currently not set)
2. Open browser console and check for network requests to `basket.databuddy.cc`
3. Use the Databuddy dashboard to view real-time events

## Best Practices

1. All events include `timestamp` for temporal analysis
2. All monetary events include `currency: "USD"` for clarity
3. Error events track failure reasons for debugging
4. Events use snake_case naming convention
5. Properties are descriptive and consistent across events
