## Usage Guide

### Creating a Company

1. **Navigate to "My Companies"** page
2. **Click "Create Company"** button
3. **Fill in the form**:

   **Required Fields**:

   - Description: What does your company do?
   - Tags: Add relevant categories
   - Logo URL: Link to your company logo

4. **Click "Create Company"**

### Tips for Best Results

#### Ticker Symbol

- Keep it short and memorable (2-4 characters ideal)
- Make it related to your company name
- Examples:
  - "Apple" → "AAPL"
  - "Tesla" → "TSLA"
  - "Microsoft" → "MSFT"
  - "QuickBuck Finance" → "QBF"

#### Logo Image

- Use a square image for best results
- Recommended size: 256x256px or larger
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, SVG, WebP
- Free logo sources:
  - [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
  - [Logo.com](https://logo.com/)
  - Make your own with Canva

#### Tags

- Be specific but not too narrow
- Use 2-5 tags per company
- Common categories:
  - Technology, Software, Hardware
  - Finance, Banking, Investing
  - E-commerce, Retail
  - Healthcare, Pharma
  - Energy, Manufacturing
  - Media, Entertainment

## Form Validation

### What Happens When:

**Missing Required Fields**:

```
- Name: "Company Name is required"
- Ticker: "Ticker symbol is required"
```

**Ticker Too Long**:

```
- Max 5 characters enforced (can't type more)
```

**Duplicate Ticker**:

```
- Error: "Ticker symbol already in use"
- Choose a different ticker
```

**Invalid Logo URL**:

```
- Image won't display in preview
- Won't break the form (gracefully fails)
```

## Database Changes

### Migration Notes

**Existing companies** created before this update will have:

- `tags`: Empty array `[]`
- `ticker`: Will need to be generated/assigned
- `logoUrl`: `undefined`

**⚠️ Important**: You'll need to run the Convex backend to apply the schema changes:

```bash
# Stop your Convex dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Restart it:
convex dev
```

The schema will automatically migrate and add the new fields to existing records.

- Image server blocking hotlinking
- Image file deleted/moved

**Solutions**:

- Use a reliable image hosting service
- Upload to imgur, cloudinary, or similar

### Tags not saving

**Check**:

- Did you click "Add" or press Enter after typing?
- Are tags showing as badges before submitting?
- Check browser console for errors

### Form won't submit

**Check**:

- Company name filled in?
- Ticker symbol filled in (1-5 chars)?
- Check console for validation errors
