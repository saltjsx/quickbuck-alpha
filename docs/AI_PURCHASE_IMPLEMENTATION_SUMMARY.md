# AI Purchase System - Implementation Summary

## 🎉 What Was Built

I've successfully implemented an AI-powered automatic product purchasing system using Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite. The system replaces the old deterministic algorithm with intelligent, human-like purchasing decisions.

---

## 📦 What You Need to Do

### 1. Get a Gemini API Key (5 minutes)

1. Go to: https://aistudio.google.com/
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Get API Key" button
4. Create a new API key (or use existing)
5. Copy the API key

**Cost:** FREE - Gemini has a generous free tier that's more than enough for this use case.

### 2. Add API Key to Environment Variables (2 minutes)

#### Local Development:
Add to your `.env.local` file:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

#### Production (Convex):
1. Go to: https://dashboard.convex.dev/
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to: Settings → Environment Variables
4. Click "Add Environment Variable"
5. Name: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
6. Value: Your Gemini API key
7. Click Save

### 3. Deploy to Convex (1 minute)

```bash
npx convex deploy
```

Wait for deployment to complete. That's it!

---

## ✅ System Verification

### Check Cron Job

1. Go to Convex Dashboard: https://dashboard.convex.dev/
2. Click on "Crons" tab
3. You should see: "AI automatic product purchases"
   - Status: ✅ Active
   - Interval: Every 20 minutes
   - Last run: (timestamp within last 20 minutes)

### Test Manually (Optional)

```bash
npm run trigger-ai-purchase
```

You should see output like:
```
🚀 Triggering AI Purchase Service
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
✅ AI Purchase Service Complete!
💰 Total spent: $8,456,234
📦 Total items: 23,456
🏷️  Products purchased: 325
📊 Batches processed: 7
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐
│  Cron Job   │ ← Runs every 20 minutes
│  (Convex)   │
└─────┬───────┘
      │
      ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│  HTTP Action        │ ← Fetches products, splits into batches
│  /api/ai-purchase   │
└─────┬───────────────┘
      │
      ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Gemini 2.5 Flash   │ ← AI evaluates each batch
│  (Google AI)        │    Makes purchasing decisions
└─────┬───────────────┘
      │
      ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│  adminAIPurchase    │ ← Executes purchases
│  (Convex Mutation)  │    Updates accounts & ledger
└─────────────────────┘
```

### Process Flow

1. **Cron triggers** (every 20 minutes)
2. **HTTP action fetches** all active products
3. **Products split** into batches of 50
4. **For each batch:**
   - AI receives product data (name, price, quality, description, etc.)
   - AI acts like the general public making purchase decisions
   - AI returns: which products to buy and how many
5. **Purchases executed** via Convex mutation
6. **Companies receive revenue** and ledger entries are created

### AI Instructions

The AI is told to:
- ✅ Spend minimum $1M per batch
- ✅ Give every product a chance
- ✅ Act like the general public
- ✅ Buy based on quality, usefulness, and price
- ✅ Avoid spam and low-quality products
- ✅ Consider what real consumers and businesses need

---

## 📊 Expected Performance

### Per Run (Every 20 Minutes)

- **Products Processed:** 300-500
- **Batches:** 6-10 (50 products each)
- **Total Spend:** $6M-$10M
- **Duration:** 30-60 seconds
- **Products Purchased:** 300-450 (varies based on AI decisions)
- **Companies Affected:** 50-100+

### Daily Totals

- **Runs per Day:** 72 (every 20 minutes)
- **Total Spend:** ~$500M-$720M
- **Products Served:** All active products get regular purchases

---

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Gemini API (Google)

**Free Tier:**
- 15 requests per minute
- 1 million tokens per minute
- FREE forever

**This System Uses:**
- ~7-10 requests per run
- Runs every 20 minutes (3 per hour)
- Well within free tier limits

**Result:** $0/month cost (stays in free tier)

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files

1. **`scripts/ai-purchase-service.ts`**
   - Standalone script for manual testing
   - Same logic as HTTP action
   - Run with: `npm run ai-purchase`

2. **`scripts/trigger-ai-purchase.ts`**
   - Triggers the HTTP action manually
   - Useful for testing
   - Run with: `npm run trigger-ai-purchase`

3. **`docs/AI_PURCHASE_SYSTEM.md`**
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Architecture, API reference, troubleshooting

## 🧪 Testing

### Immediate Test (Optional)

```bash
# Make sure dependencies are installed
npm install

# Test the system
npm run trigger-ai-purchase
```

### Wait for Cron (Recommended)

1. Deploy: `npx convex deploy`
2. Wait up to 20 minutes
3. Check Convex Dashboard → Logs
4. Look for: "🤖 AI Purchase cron triggered"
5. Watch company balances increase

---

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Convex Dashboard

**Crons Tab:**
- "AI automatic product purchases" should be Active
- Last run timestamp updates every 20 minutes

**Logs Tab:**
- Search for: "AI Purchase"
- You'll see:
  - Cron triggers
  - HTTP action execution
  - AI decisions
  - Purchase completions

**Data Tab:**
- Check `ledger` table for `ai_purchase` entries
- Check `accounts` table for increasing balances

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "GEMINI_API_KEY not configured" | Add key to Convex environment variables |
| "Unauthorized" error | Verify `ADMIN_KEY` is set |
| Cron not triggering | Redeploy: `npx convex deploy` |
| Test command fails | Run: `npm install` |
| Low spending per batch | AI decides based on product quality/usefulness |

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check if cron is running
# → Convex Dashboard → Crons tab

# Test manually
npm run trigger-ai-purchase

# View logs
# → Convex Dashboard → Logs tab

# Check environment variables
# → Convex Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
```

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If you need to revert to the old system:

1. Edit `convex/crons.ts`:
   ```typescript
   crons.interval(
     "automatic product purchases",
     { minutes: 10 },
     internal.products.automaticPurchase
   );
   ```

2. Deploy: `npx convex deploy`

The old function is still in the codebase, so rollback is instant.

## 🎯 Key Differences from Old System

| Aspect | Old System | New AI System |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **Algorithm** | Deterministic | AI-powered |
| **Behavior** | Fixed weights | Realistic, varied |
| **Frequency** | Every 10 min | Every 20 min |
| **Spend/Run** | Exactly $5M | $6M-$10M |
| **Product Selection** | Revenue-weighted | Quality + usefulness |
| **Spam Protection** | None | AI identifies and avoids |
| **Batch Processing** | All at once | 50 products per batch |
