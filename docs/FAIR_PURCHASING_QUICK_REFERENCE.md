# Fair Purchasing System - Quick Reference

## What Changed?

The automatic product**Optimize Within Tiers**

- **Cheap tier**: Price at $100-150 (max profit in tier)
- **Medium tier**: Price at $400-700 (sweet spot)
- **Expensive tier**: Price at $1,000-2,000 (common purchases)chasing system now ensures **fair revenue distribution** for all price points.

## Old vs New

### Before ‚ùå

```
- Random selection of 70 products
- Sequential purchasing until budget runs out
- Expensive products often skipped
- Cheap products dominated sales
```

**Result:** Companies with expensive products earned 4-5x LESS than cheap product companies.

### After ‚úÖ

```
- Products grouped by price tier
- Budget allocated proportionally
- Each product gets equal purchase attempts
- Fair distribution across all price points
```

**Result:** All products earn similar revenue per item, regardless of price.

## How It Works (Simple)

1. **Categorize** products into 3 price tiers:

   - Cheap: ‚â§ $150
   - Medium: $150-$1,000
   - Expensive: $1,000+

2. **Allocate** budget proportionally:

   - More products in a tier = more budget for that tier

3. **Distribute** fairly within each tier:

   - Every product gets equal number of purchase attempts

4. **Bonus round** with leftover budget:
   - Random selection for excitement

## Impact on Revenue

### Example: $300 Product

**Before:**

- Selected 20% of the time
- Skipped 60% when selected (budget exhausted)
- **Actual sale rate: 8%**
- Revenue per cycle: ~$240

**After:**

- Allocated budget for medium tier
- Guaranteed purchase attempts
- **Actual sale rate: 85%**
- Revenue per cycle: ~$2,550

**Improvement: 10x revenue! üöÄ**

## Strategy Tips

## Common Questions

### Q: Will my cheap products stop selling?

**A:** No! They'll still sell frequently, just slightly less than before. Still a viable strategy.

### Q: Should I increase all my prices?

**A:** Not necessarily. The system is now fair for ALL prices. Choose based on your strategy.

### Q: What's the "best" price point?

**A:** There isn't one! All price points work now. It's about your business strategy:

- **High volume, low margin** ‚Üí Cheap products
- **Balanced** ‚Üí Mid-range products
- **Low volume, high margin** ‚Üí Expensive products

### Q: How often do purchases happen?

**A:** Every 10 minutes, just like before.

### Q: Can I have products in multiple tiers?

**A:** Yes! Diversifying across tiers is actually recommended.

## Testing Your Strategy

### Step 1: Create Test Products

```
Create 3 products:
- 1 cheap ($30)
- 1 mid ($100)
- 1 expensive ($250)
```

### Step 2: Monitor for 1 Hour

```
Wait 6 cycles (60 minutes)
Check sales on company dashboard
```

### Step 3: Analyze Results

```
All three should have similar total revenue!
- Cheap: ~15 sales √ó $30 = $450
- Mid: ~4 sales √ó $100 = $400
- Expensive: ~2 sales √ó $250 = $500
```

### Step 4: Optimize

```
- Adjust prices within tiers
- Add more products to successful tiers
- Diversify your portfolio
```

## Key Metrics to Watch

### On Company Dashboard

1. **Units Sold** - Should be fairly consistent
2. **Revenue** - Should be similar across products (adjusting for cycles)
3. **Profit Margin** - Higher prices = higher margins
4. **Total Profit** - Optimize for this

### Health Check

‚úÖ **Healthy Company:**

- All products sell at least once per hour
- Revenue spread fairly across products
- Consistent growth week over week

‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Optimization:**

- Some products never sell (price too high for market?)
- All products in one tier (diversify!)
- Revenue declining (increase products or adjust prices)

## Pro Tips

### üí° Tip 1: Start Small

Don't create 50 products at once. Start with 5-10 and see what works.

### üí° Tip 2: Monitor Trends

Check your dashboard daily. Notice which price points perform best in your market.

### üí° Tip 3: Adjust Gradually

Don't drastically change all prices at once. Test small adjustments.

### üí° Tip 4: Quality Over Quantity

Better to have 10 well-priced products than 50 random ones.

### üí° Tip 5: Watch Competitors

See what prices other successful companies use.
