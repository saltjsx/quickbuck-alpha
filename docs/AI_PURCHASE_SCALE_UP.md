# AI Purchase System Scale-Up - Large Bulk Orders

## Summary

Scaled up the AI purchase system to generate millions to tens of millions of dollars in revenue for companies. The system now prioritizes quality while buying in massive bulk quantities.

## Changes Made

### 1. **AI Purchase Service Script** (`scripts/ai-purchase-service.ts`)

#### Minimum Spend Increase
- **Before:** $1M minimum per batch
- **After:** $10M minimum per batch (10x increase)
- This ensures each batch of AI purchases generates substantial revenue

#### Enhanced AI Prompt
Added detailed instructions for bulk purchasing:
- **High-quality products (90-100):** 1,000-50,000+ units
- **Medium-quality products (70-89):** 500-10,000 units  
- **Low-quality products (50-69):** 100-500 units
- **Very low quality (<50):** 1-50 units (minimal)

**Quantity Guidelines by Price:**
- Cheap items ($1-$50): 5,000-50,000+ units
- Budget items ($50-$500): 1,000-10,000 units
- Mid-range ($500-$5,000): 100-2,000 units
- Premium items ($5,000-$50,000): 10-500 units
- Luxury items ($50,000+): 1-100 units only

**Key Instructions:**
- ✅ PRIORITIZE QUALITY - high quality items get 5-10x larger orders
- ✅ BUY IN LARGE QUANTITIES - aim for millions in total spending
- ✅ Scale quantities up 5-10x compared to normal retail
- ✅ Give most products 5-50+ units to be fair

### 2. **Automatic Purchase Function** (`convex/products.ts` - `automaticPurchase`)

#### Total Spend Increase
- **Before:** $5M per run
- **After:** $50M per run (10x increase)

#### Bonus Purchase Quantities (10x Scale-Up)
Dramatically increased quantities for bonus purchases:

| Category | Before | After | Multiplier |
|----------|--------|-------|------------|
| Cheap items (<$50) | 50-80 units | 500-1,000 units | 10x |
| Mid-range ($50-$200) | 30-50 units | 200-400 units | 7x |
| Expensive ($200+) | 10-20 units | 50-100 units | 5x |

### 3. **Admin AI Purchase Mutation** (`convex/products.ts` - `adminAIPurchase`)

#### Quantity Limit Increase
- **Before:** Maximum 100 units per purchase
- **After:** Maximum 100,000 units per purchase (1000x increase)

This allows the AI to specify massive bulk orders when needed.

## Impact on Companies

### Revenue Generation Examples

**Before (per batch):**
- Average product: 1-5 units → $50-500 per product
- High quality product: 10-20 units → $1,000-5,000 per product
- Company might earn: $500K-$2M per batch

**After (per batch):**
- Average product: 100-1,000 units → $5,000-50,000+ per product
- High quality product: 5,000-50,000 units → $500K-$50M+ per product
- Company can earn: **$10M-$50M+ per batch**

### Quality Still Prioritized ✅

The AI prompt explicitly emphasizes:
1. **High-quality products get 5-10x larger orders** than low quality
2. Skip or minimize purchases of spam/suspicious products
3. Focus on usefulness and real consumer needs
4. Quality is the PRIMARY filtering factor before quantity

## How It Works Together

```
AI Service Loop (every 20 minutes):
├─ Fetch all active products
├─ Split into batches of 50 products
└─ For each batch:
   ├─ AI evaluates products (prioritizing quality)
   ├─ AI requests $10M worth of bulk orders
   ├─ Preferentially buys high-quality items in 1000s-10000s
   └─ Company receives millions in revenue

Automatic Purchase Fallback:
├─ Spends $50M across all products
├─ Scales up bonus purchases 5-10x
└─ High-quality items get proportionally larger orders
```

## Files Modified

1. `scripts/ai-purchase-service.ts`
   - Increased `MIN_SPEND_PER_BATCH` from $1M to $10M
   - Enhanced AI prompt with bulk purchase guidelines
   - Added quality-based quantity multipliers

2. `convex/products.ts`
   - Increased `automaticPurchase` total spend from $5M to $50M
   - Scaled up bonus purchase quantities 5-10x
   - Increased `adminAIPurchase` max quantity from 100 to 100,000

## Testing

All changes have been **typechecked and verified** with no errors.

### Expected Results

When AI purchases run:
- ✅ Companies will make $10M-$50M per batch
- ✅ High-quality products get significantly more units
- ✅ Low-quality products are avoided/minimized
- ✅ Revenue scales with product quality
- ✅ Bulk purchase behavior feels realistic

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Monitor company revenue distribution
2. Adjust minimum spend per batch if needed
3. Fine-tune AI quality thresholds if desired
4. Track which companies reach millions vs tens of millions
