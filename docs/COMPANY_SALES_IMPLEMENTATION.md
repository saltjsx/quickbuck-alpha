# Company Sale System Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive system that allows players to sell their companies to other players. The seller sets the price, and when a buyer purchases the company, all assets, products, stocks, and ownership are transferred.

## Backend Changes

### Schema Updates (`convex/schema.ts`)

     - `sellerId`: The current owner selling
     - `buyerId`: Optional specific buyer (null for open market)
     - `price`: The asking price
     - `status`: "active", "completed", or "cancelled"
     - `createdAt`, `completedAt`: Timestamps
   - Indexes for efficient querying by company, seller, buyer, and status

2. **Updated Ledger Type**
   - Added `"company_sale"` transaction type to track company purchases

     - Transfers company access rights
     - Transfers all stock holdings from seller to buyer
     - Marks offer as completed
     - Cancels any other active offers for the company
   - Creates ledger entry for the transaction

4. **`getActiveSaleOffers`** - Query
   - Returns all active sale offers
   - Optionally filters for a specific buyer
   - Enriches data with company and seller information

## Database Performance

The implementation follows the bandwidth optimization patterns from AGENTS.md:
- Uses compound indexes for efficient queries
- Batch fetches related data (companies, accounts, sellers)
- Limits result sets (50 offers max)
- Uses cached account balances
- Efficient status filtering with indexes

## Usage Example

### Selling a Company:
1. Navigate to "My Companies" or company dashboard
2. Click "Sell Company" button
3. Enter desired price (or use suggested price)
4. Confirm listing
5. Company appears in "Company Sales" marketplace

### Buying a Company:
1. Navigate to "Company Sales" from sidebar
2. Browse available companies
3. Click "Purchase Company" on desired company
4. Select payment account
5. Confirm purchase
6. Instantly receive ownership
