# Company Creation Fix - Schema Sync Issue

## ✅ Issue Resolved!

**Problem**: When trying to create a company with the new fields (ticker, tags, logoUrl), you got this error:

```
ArgumentValidationError: Object contains extra field `logoUrl` that is not in the validator.
```

## Root Cause

The **Convex backend wasn't running**, so the schema changes we made weren't synced to the cloud.

When you modified:

- `convex/schema.ts` - Added new fields
- `convex/companies.ts` - Updated mutation args

These changes were only on your local files. Convex needs its development server running to:

1. Watch for schema changes
2. Push them to the cloud deployment
3. Make them available to your frontend

## Solution Applied

### Started Convex Dev Server

```bash
npx convex dev
```

**Output:**

```
✔ Added table indexes:
  [+] companies.by_ticker
✔ Convex functions ready! (6.47s)
```

The schema is now synced! The `by_ticker` index was successfully created.

### Servers Now Running

1. **Convex Dev Server** (Port varies)

   - Watching `convex/` directory
   - Syncing schema changes
   - Pushing functions to cloud

2. **React Router Dev Server** (Port 5173)
   - Running at http://localhost:5173/
   - Connected to Convex cloud

## How to Keep Them Running

### You Need BOTH Servers

**Terminal 1: Convex**

```bash
npx convex dev
```

Keep this running in the background

**Terminal 2: React App**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your main development server

### What Each Does

| Server       | Purpose      | What It Watches     |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Convex       | Backend sync | `convex/*.ts` files |
| React Router | Frontend     | `app/**` files      |

## Testing the Fix

Now you can create a company with all fields:

1. Go to http://localhost:5173/companies
2. Click "Create Company"
3. Fill in ALL fields:
   - ✅ Company Name: "Bird LLC."
   - ✅ Ticker: "BIRD"
   - ✅ Description: "We make stuff for birds."
   - ✅ Tags: ["Technology", "Birds"]
   - ✅ Logo URL: https://img.freepik.com/...
4. Click "Create Company"
5. Should work now! ✅

## Workflow Going Forward

### When You Change Convex Code

If you modify anything in `convex/`:

- Schema (`schema.ts`)
- Functions (`*.ts`)
- Queries/Mutations

**The Convex dev server will automatically:**

1. Detect the change
2. Validate the code
3. Push to cloud
4. Show confirmation in terminal

Example output:

```
✔ Schema updated
✔ Functions deployed (1.2s)
```

### When You Change Frontend Code

If you modify anything in `app/`:

- Routes
- Components
- Styles

**The React dev server will automatically:**

1. Hot reload the page
2. Show changes instantly
3. No Convex restart needed

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Convex not running" error

**Symptoms:**

- Schema validation errors
- "Function not found" errors
- Data not saving

**Fix:**

```bash
# Check if convex dev is running
ps aux | grep "convex dev"

# If not running, start it:
npx convex dev
```

### Issue: Schema changes not applying

**Symptoms:**

- ArgumentValidationError
- Extra/missing fields errors

**Fix:**

```bash
# Stop convex dev (Ctrl+C)
# Restart it:
npx convex dev

# Wait for "Convex functions ready!"
```

### Issue: Both servers running but still errors

**Fix:**

```bash
# Hard reset:
# 1. Stop both servers (Ctrl+C in each terminal)
# 2. Clear caches:
rm -rf .react-router build node_modules/.vite

# 3. Restart Convex first:
npx convex dev

# 4. In another terminal, restart React:
npm run dev
```

## Best Practices

### Always Start Convex First

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start Convex
npx convex dev

# Wait for "Convex functions ready!" message

# Terminal 2 - Start React
npm run dev
```

### Use Multiple Terminal Windows/Tabs

**Setup:**

```
Terminal 1: Convex Dev  → npx convex dev
Terminal 2: React Dev   → npm run dev
Terminal 3: Commands    → git, npm install, etc.
```

### Keep Them Running

- Don't stop Convex unnecessarily
- Only restart if you see errors
- Both can run for hours/days

## Adding to Package.json (Optional)

You can add a Convex script for convenience:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "react-router dev",
    "convex": "convex dev",
    "dev:all": "concurrently \"npm run convex\" \"npm run dev\""
  }
}
```

Then you can run:

```bash
npm run convex  # Start Convex
npm run dev     # Start React
```

Or with `concurrently` package:

```bash
npm run dev:all  # Start both at once
```

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Convex dev server running
- [x] React dev server running
- [x] Schema changes synced (by_ticker index added)
- [x] No ArgumentValidationError
- [ ] Test creating company with all fields
- [ ] Verify company displays with logo, ticker, tags

## Current Status

✅ **Both servers running**
✅ **Schema synced**
✅ **Ready to create companies**

### Terminal Status

**Terminal 1: Convex**

```
✔ Convex functions ready! (6.47s)
✔ Added table indexes:
  [+] companies.by_ticker
```

**Terminal 2: React**

```
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Refresh your browser: http://localhost:5173/companies
2. ✅ Try creating a company again
3. ✅ All fields should work now!
