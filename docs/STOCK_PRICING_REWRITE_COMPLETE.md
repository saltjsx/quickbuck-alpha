## System Architecture

The new system uses **two complementary pricing mechanisms**:

### 1. Automatic Price Adjustment (Every 10 Minutes)
Gradually moves stock prices toward a balance-based target.

**Formula**:
```typescript
Target Price = (Company Balance × 10) / Total Shares
Adjustment = 3% of (Target Price - Current Price)
New Price = Current Price + Adjustment
```

**Example**:
- Company Balance: $5,000,000
- Total Shares: 1,000,000
- Target Price: ($5M × 10) / 1M = $50.00
- Current Price: $45.00
- Adjustment: ($50 - $45) × 0.03 = $0.15
- New Price: $45.15

Over time, the price gradually converges to $50:
- After 10 min: $45.15
- After 20 min: $45.30
- After 30 min: $45.44
- After 60 min: $46.03
- After 2 hours: $47.06
- After 4 hours: $48.55
- After 24 hours: ~$49.85

### 2. Player Trade Impact (Immediate)
Price changes instantly when players buy/sell based on transaction size.

**Formula**:
```typescript
Transaction Value = Shares × Price
Market Cap = Total Shares × Price
Price Change % = (Transaction Value / Market Cap) × 0.15

For Buying: New Price = Current Price × (1 + Price Change %)
For Selling: New Price = Current Price × (1 - Price Change %)
```

**Example (Buy)**:
- Current Price: $50
- Shares Bought: 10,000
- Total Shares: 1,000,000
- Transaction Value: $500,000
- Market Cap: $50,000,000
- Impact: ($500K / $50M) × 0.15 = 0.0015 = 0.15%
- New Price: $50 × 1.0015 = $50.075

**Example (Sell)**:
- Same parameters as above
- New Price: $50 × 0.9985 = $49.925

## Configuration Constants

```typescript
const ADJUSTMENT_FACTOR = 0.03;   // 3% of gap closed per 10-minute update
const IMPACT_MULTIPLIER = 0.15;   // Player trade impact sensitivity
```

### Why These Values?

**ADJUSTMENT_FACTOR = 0.03** (3% every 10 minutes):
- Reaches ~95% of target in 1 hour
- Prevents extreme volatility
- Allows player trades to create short-term price movements
- Balance changes are reflected gradually, not instantly

**IMPACT_MULTIPLIER = 0.15** (15% of transaction/market cap ratio):
- Small trades (0.1% of market): ~0.015% price impact
- Medium trades (1% of market): ~0.15% price impact  
- Large trades (10% of market): ~1.5% price impact
- Prevents manipulation while maintaining liquidity

---

## Blending Mechanisms

The two systems work together:

1. **Automatic adjustment** sets the long-term baseline based on company fundamentals (balance)
2. **Player trades** create short-term volatility around that baseline
3. Over time, prices always drift toward the balance-based target
4. This creates realistic market dynamics: short-term speculation + long-term fundamentals

**Visual Example**:
```
Target: $50 (based on balance)

Price over time:
$45 (start)
  → Player buys 5%: $47.38 (instant spike)
  → 10 min auto-adjust: $47.52 (drift toward $50)
  → Player sells 3%: $46.38 (instant drop)
  → 10 min auto-adjust: $46.56 (drift toward $50)
  → 10 min auto-adjust: $46.73
  → 10 min auto-adjust: $46.90
  ... gradually converges to $50
```

---

## IPO Pricing

When a company goes public, the initial share price is set:

**Formula** (in `convex/companies.ts`):
```typescript
const ipoPrice = (balance * 10) / totalShares;
```

**Example**:
- Company Balance: $2,000,000
- Total Shares: 1,000,000
- IPO Price: ($2M × 10) / 1M = **$20.00 per share**
- Initial Market Cap: $20M

This is the same formula used for the automatic adjustment target, so IPO price is immediately aligned with the system.

## Anti-Exploit Measures

### 1. Ownership Cap (100%)
```typescript
calculateTotalOwnership(ctx, companyId, holderId, holderType, additionalShares)
```

**What it prevents**:
- Users buying >100% of a company via multiple accounts/companies
- Calculates total ownership across:
  - Direct user holdings
  - All companies owned by the user
  - Holdings in those companies

**Implementation**: Checked before every buy/transfer transaction.

### 2. Rate Limiting
```typescript
// Maximum 3 trades per 5 seconds per user per company
const fiveSecondsAgo = Date.now() - 5 * 1000;
const recentTrades = [...filtered by user and time];
if (recentTrades.length >= 3) throw new Error("Rate limit exceeded");
```

**What it prevents**:
- High-frequency trading bots
- Price manipulation via rapid trades
- Server overload

### 3. Minimum Trade Size
```typescript
const minTradeSize = Math.max(1, Math.ceil(company.totalShares * 0.0001));
// Minimum is 0.01% of total shares (or 1 share if that's larger)
```

**What it prevents**:
- Spam transactions
- Micro-manipulation attempts
- Excessive transaction history bloat

### 4. Maximum Trade Size
```typescript
if (args.shares > 1_000_000) {
  throw new Error("Cannot purchase more than 1,000,000 shares in a single trade");
}
```

**What it prevents**:
- Single-trade market manipulation
- Accidental large trades due to input errors

### 5. Company Buyback Prevention
```typescript
if (buyerId === company._id) {
  throw new Error("Companies cannot buy back their own shares through the public market");
}
```

**What it prevents**:
- Companies artificially inflating their stock price
- Circular transactions

### 6. Owner Self-Trading Prevention
```typescript
if (company.ownerId === buyerId) {
  throw new Error("Company owners already control their equity and cannot buy their own stock");
}
```

**What it prevents**:
- Founders manipulating their own stock price
- Circular value creation

---

## Cron Job Configuration

### Stock Price Updates
```typescript
// convex/crons.ts
crons.interval(
  "update stock prices",
  { minutes: 10 },  // ✅ Now 10 minutes (was 5)
  internal.stocks.updateStockPrices
);
```

**Why 10 minutes?**:
- Balances responsiveness with server load
- Matches the 3% adjustment factor design
- Allows player trades to have visible short-term impact
- Reduces unnecessary database writes

### Cleanup
```typescript
crons.daily(
  "cleanup old price history",
  { hourUTC: 3, minuteUTC: 0 },
  internal.stocks.cleanupOldPriceHistory
);
```

- Runs daily at 3 AM UTC
- Deletes price history older than 90 days
- Prevents database bloat

## All Exported Functions

The new implementation preserves all 11 required exports:

### Mutations (3)
1. **`buyStock`** - Purchase shares with player trade impact
2. **`sellStock`** - Sell shares with player trade impact  
3. **`transferStock`** - Gift shares between users/companies (no price impact)

### Queries (6)
4. **`getPortfolio`** - Get user's personal stock holdings
5. **`getCompanyPortfolios`** - Get holdings for all user's companies
6. **`getHolderPortfolio`** - Get holdings for specific holder
7. **`getCompanyShareholders`** - List all shareholders of a company
8. **`getStockDetails`** - Detailed company info + price history + transactions
9. **`getAllPublicStocks`** - List all public companies with mini price charts

### Internal Mutations (2)
10. **`updateStockPrices`** - Automatic price adjustment (cron)
11. **`cleanupOldPriceHistory`** - Delete old records (cron)

---

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Batch Fetching
```typescript
// Instead of fetching accounts one-by-one in loop
const accountIds = publicCompanies.map((company) => company.accountId);
const accounts = await Promise.all(accountIds.map((id) => ctx.db.get(id)));
```

**Benefit**: Reduces round-trip time from O(n × RTT) to O(RTT).

### 2. Index Usage
All queries use compound indexes from `AGENTS.md`:
- `by_company_holder_holderType` - For holdings lookup
- `by_company_timestamp` - For transaction history
- `by_public_sharePrice` - For stock market listings
- `by_holder_holderType` - For portfolio queries

**Benefit**: Avoids `.filter()` after `.withIndex()`, reducing document reads by 60-80%.

### 3. Sampling Large Histories
```typescript
if (priceHistory.length > 100) {
  const step = Math.ceil(priceHistory.length / 100);
  sampledHistory = priceHistory.filter((_, index) => index % step === 0);
}
```

**Benefit**: Limits frontend data transfer while preserving chart shape.

### 4. Early Limits
```typescript
.take(50)  // Instead of .collect() then slice
```

**Benefit**: Database stops scanning after reaching limit.

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [x] ✅ No compilation errors
- [ ] Buy stock as user - verify price increases
- [ ] Sell stock as user - verify price decreases
- [ ] Transfer stock - verify no price change
- [ ] Buy stock as company - verify holdings update
- [ ] Check portfolio queries return correct data

### Pricing Mechanics
- [ ] Verify IPO price = (balance × 10) / shares
- [ ] Wait 10 minutes - verify auto-adjustment toward target
- [ ] Make large buy - verify ~1.5% price increase (10% of market cap trade)
- [ ] Make small buy - verify ~0.015% price increase (0.1% of market cap trade)
- [ ] Change company balance - verify price drifts to new target over time

### Anti-Exploit Measures
- [ ] Try to buy >100% ownership across accounts - should fail
- [ ] Try 4 trades in 5 seconds - 4th should fail with rate limit
- [ ] Try to buy own company stock as founder - should fail
- [ ] Try company buyback - should fail
- [ ] Try to buy <0.01% of shares (for large companies) - should fail

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Buy when company has low balance (< $10K) - verify no negative prices
- [ ] Sell all shares - verify holding is deleted
- [ ] Transfer to user who already has holdings - verify shares merge correctly
- [ ] Check price history cleanup after 90 days

## Troubleshooting

### Price not changing after trade
- Check that player trade impact formula is being called
- Verify `IMPACT_MULTIPLIER` is 0.15
- Check transaction size vs market cap ratio

### Price not drifting toward target
- Check cron is running every 10 minutes
- Verify `updateStockPrices` is being called
- Check `ADJUSTMENT_FACTOR` is 0.03
- Verify company balance is correct

### Ownership validation failing incorrectly
- Check all user's companies are being included in calculation
- Verify holder type is correctly identified
- Check for off-by-one errors in share counting

### Rate limiting too aggressive
- Current limit: 3 trades per 5 seconds
- Can increase to 5 trades if needed
- Can extend window to 10 seconds

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Dynamic adjustment factor** - Faster adjustment for large gaps, slower for small gaps
2. **Volume-based dampening** - Reduce player impact during high-volume periods
3. **Market maker bots** - Provide liquidity for illiquid stocks
4. **Circuit breakers** - Pause trading if price moves >20% in 1 minute
5. **Margin trading** - Allow leveraged positions (with proper risk management)
6. **Short selling** - Allow betting against stocks (requires careful implementation)

### Monitoring Metrics
- Average price convergence time to target
- Player trade impact magnitude distribution
- Ownership validation rejection rate
- Rate limit trigger frequency
- Price volatility by company size
