## 💡 Pro Tips

### Making Money Fast

1. **Multiple Products**: List 5-10 products per company
2. **Competitive Pricing**: $50-$150 sweet spot
3. **Multiple Companies**: Diversify your revenue streams
4. **Catchy Names**: Products with good names sell better (psychologically!)

### Pricing Strategy

- **Too Low** ($1-$30): Small profits, but higher selection chance
- **Sweet Spot** ($50-$150): Good profit margins
- **Too High** ($200+): Large profits if selected, but less likely

### Calculating Profitability

```
Average Production Cost = 45% of price
Expected Profit = Price × 55%

Example:
$100 product = $55 profit per sale
$200 product = $110 profit per sale
```

### Investment Strategy

1. **Early Entry**: Invest in companies close to $50K
2. **Diversify**: Don't put all money in one company
3. **Track Performance**: Monitor company balances
4. **Long-term Hold**: Companies grow over time
