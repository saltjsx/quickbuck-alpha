## 💡 Pro Tips

### Making Money Fast

1. **Multiple Products**: List 5-10 products per company
2. **Diverse Pricing**: Mix cheap, mid-range, and expensive products
3. **Multiple Companies**: Diversify your revenue streams
4. **Catchy Names**: Products with good names sell better (psychologically!)

### Pricing Strategy (NEW: Fair System! 🎉)

**All price points are now equally viable!** The system ensures fair revenue distribution:

- **Cheap** (≤$150): High volume, consistent revenue
- **Medium** ($150-$1,000): Balanced volume and margins (recommended for beginners)
- **Expensive** ($1,000+): Lower volume but high profits per sale

**Key Insight:** All products earn similar revenue per item now. Choose based on your strategy, not just "go cheap"!

### Calculating Profitability

```
Average Production Cost = 45% of price
Expected Profit = Price × 55%

Example - Revenue Per Cycle (10 min):
$100 product:  ~10 sales = $1,000 revenue
$500 product:  ~2 sales = $1,000 revenue
$2,000 product: ~1 sale = $2,000 revenue

All earn similar or better amounts! ✅
```

### Recommended Portfolio

**Diversified approach for maximum revenue:**

```
10 Products Total:
- 3 Cheap (≤$150):       Steady volume
- 4 Medium ($200-$800):  Core profit drivers
- 3 Expensive ($1,000+): High margin items
```

### Investment Strategy

1. **Early Entry**: Invest in companies close to $50K
2. **Diversify**: Don't put all money in one company
3. **Track Performance**: Monitor company balances
4. **Long-term Hold**: Companies grow over time
